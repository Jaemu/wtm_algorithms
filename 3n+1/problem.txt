Problem: 3n + 1

Source: HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/doyoulikeit/challenges/the-3n-1-problem)

Description:

Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers.

Start with an integer n. If n is even, divide by 2. If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the new value of n, terminating when n = 1.

For example, the following sequence of numbers will be generated for n = 22:

22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

It is conjectured (but not yet proven) that this algorithm will terminate at n = 1 for every integer n. Still, the conjecture holds for all integers up to at least 1,000,000. For an input n, the cycle-length of n is the number of numbers generated up to and including the 1.

In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16.

Given an integer i determine the cycle length .

Input Format

An integer n

Output Format

An integer : cycle length

Sample Input

22

Sample Output

16

Explanation

for n = 22:

22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

Cycle length = 16
